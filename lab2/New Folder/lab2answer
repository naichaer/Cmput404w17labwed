#!/user/bin/env python
import socket
serverSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question2
both client and server can send and receive. So the distinction is not in the sending and receiving. It is in how the connection is created.
Server Socket - is created to bind() to a port and listen() for a connect() from a client. So a server just waits for a conversation and doesn't start one.
Client Socket - is created to connect() to a listen() server. The client initiates the connection

Printed: Got a connection from ('127.0.0.1', 35314)
